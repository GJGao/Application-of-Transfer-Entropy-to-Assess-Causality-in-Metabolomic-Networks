# Application-of-Transfer-Entropy-to-Assess-Causality-in-Metabolomic-Networks

My third research project at the Centre for Computation, Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology at University College London (UCL CoMPLEX).

In this repository, you can find a detailed report describing my work as well as a relevant Python module I wrote during the research process.
